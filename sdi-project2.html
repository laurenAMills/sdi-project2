<p>I choose to code out the topic of my very needed vacation that I wish was happening. I was raised in Asia, Bangkok Thailand, until I was 10.  I have not been back since we left and have been dreaming of doing so since. </p>
<p>It was really interesting using github for our project storing.  At first I could not begin to figure out what i was trying to do in terminal.  After watching the videos that were provided a few more times and just practicing it has become second nature.  Its actualy a super helpful tool and look fowad to using it throught my time at fullsail. </p>
<p> Starting to have a lot of fun and i am looking foward to the next assignment!</p>
